In this project, I developed a propositional logic system using Python, encapsulated in the logic.py file, which includes representations
of logical symbols, connectives (such as AND, OR, NOT), and functions for checking logical representations and entailments.

The logic.py file contains helpful propositional logic representations using Python such as logic symbols (assertion of reality), 
logical connectives (and, or, not...), and functions to check the logical representation and entailments (formula, model_check). 
And the remaining four files contain the utilization of propositional logics

Additionally, I created a scenario involving a character named Harry, structured with the following logical assertions:

If it's not raining, then Harry visited Hagrid.
Harry either visited Hagrid or visited Dumbledore.
Harry cannot visit both Hagrid and Dumbledore.
Harry visited Dumbledore.

Using these statements, I formulated a query to determine whether it is raining or not. Although it seems obvious that it is raining,
the project illustrates how Python's implementation of propositional logic can enable an AI to deduce this conclusion through logical reasoning
